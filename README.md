This mod adds a quest menu that displays all quests. The menu can be opened by pressing the X key. Clicking on a quest reveals the journal entries associated with that quest.

You can change the default key for opening the menu in the Options -> Scripts -> OpenMW Quest Status Menu

This mod was inspired by Quest Log Menu. However, the OpenMW engine currently lacks the necessary functionality to fully recreate a more advanced quest log system such as linking to related topics, scroll bars or including search and filter capabilities.

Feel free to suggest features and improvements, or to contribute yourself: Github

## Features ##

All quests will be in one easy-to-use menu. Say good bye to your messy journal.
You can follow a quest and pin it on your user interface. It keeps you informed about what you need to do.
Hide quests that you don't want to clutter up your list. When the time comes, you can display them again.
Official translations for English and German (reach out to me if you want to add more)

## Recommendations ##

I highly recommend using SSQN along with this mod. Icons for quests will only be shown if SSQN is installed. This mod must be below SSQN in the load order.

If you prefer the old minimalistic version you can still download the old file (version 0.5.1)

## Installation ##

Download the mod and extract its content.
Append the mod directory to the OpenMW's Data Directories (OpenMW -> Data Files -> Data Directories -> right top button labelled Append -> select mod folder which contains the scripts folder).
Enable the mod (OpenMW -> Data Files -> Content Files -> tick the checkbox of questmenu.omwscripts).
Enjoy.

## FAQ ##

Can I use this mod with old save games?
Yes its possible, but it will only show the latest journal entry for quests, which had been started before the mod was active.
I am using GUI scaling which causes the menu to be cut off.
Try adjusting customization settings in Options -> Scripts -> OpenMW Quest Menu
Change Widget Max Width, Widget Max Height,Widget Max Icon Size and/or Text Size
Reload your save game to see changes
